# gaih-machine_learning_project

In this project, we use 70% of the data to train machine learning and 30% to test its accuracy.

Then we train and test for different models.

     Logistic Classifier
     Ridge Classifier
     Decision Tree
     Naive Bayes
     Neural Network

Then we compare the performances of all these models. We see that Decision Trees give the best results in the performance comparison.

We go one step further and perform the same operations with the Random Forest model and we see that we get the same result with the Decision Tree and we conclude that there is no difference between using a Decision Tree or a Random Forest for this dataset. Since the initial values of the models are randomly generated, it is possible to obtain different results each time. Always keep this in mind when evaluating and comparing models.
